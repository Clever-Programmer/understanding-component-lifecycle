This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Building

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### npm scripts

- `npm start` - start development server
- `npm run build` - build into the `build/` directory
- `npm test` - Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode
- `npm run eject` - If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
